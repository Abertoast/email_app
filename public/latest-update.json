  "description": "We've redesigned the results UI! Emails and their AI-processed results now appear together in unified cards, making it easier to review and act on your messages.\n\nYou can now filter results using both tags (AI-extracted) and flags (labels/folders). The new filter UI supports \"OR\" logic within tags or flags, and \"AND\" logic between the two groupsâ€”so you can find emails matching any selected tag and any selected flag.\n\nLabels and folders are now visually merged as chips, with duplicate names shown only once and clear color coding for system/user labels and folders.\n\nTry out the new experience and let us know what you think!"
