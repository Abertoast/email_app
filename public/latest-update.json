  "description": "You can now instantly view the exact results of any past query! The Query History page features a new \"Show Results\" button for each entry. Click it to open a dedicated results view, where you'll see all emails and AI-processed results as they were at the time of the query. Explore, filter, and copy results just like on the dashboard. This makes it easy to revisit, share, or analyze previous queriesâ€”no need to re-run them."
