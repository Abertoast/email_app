  "description": "**May 9, 2025 — Major Improvements:**\n\n- **Download CSV:** Export filtered or processed results as a CSV file from the dashboard and results views.\n- **Per-Prompt Model & Temperature:** Saved prompts can now specify a model and temperature, or use the global default.\n- **Increased Email Fetch Limit:** Fetch and process up to 1000 emails at a time, with processing done in batches of 100 for reliability and to respect LLM API rate limits. Progress is shown in the UI.\n\n**Previously (May 7, 2025):**\n\n- **Query History: View Past Results!**\n    - Instantly view the exact results of any past query.\n    - Use the new \"Show Results\" button in Query History to open a dedicated results view.\n    - Explore, filter, and copy results just like on the dashboard.\n    - Makes it easy to revisit, share, or analyze previous queries—no need to re-run them.\n"
